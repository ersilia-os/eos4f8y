# One-molecule MolLib

MolLib is a low-resource generative model trained on ChEMBL data. It is able to generate drug-like and natural-product-like compounds. In this implementation, given an intial molecule, we first sample similar compounds and then we train the generator.

## Identifiers

* EOS model ID: `eos4f8y`
* Slug: `one-molecule-mollib`

## Characteristics

* Input: `Compound`
* Input Shape: `Single`
* Task: `Generative`
* Output: `Compound`
* Output Type: `String`
* Output Shape: `List`
* Interpretation: Compounds generated by mollib around the chemical space of the input compound
